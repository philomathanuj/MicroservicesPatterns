1. Use the following command which will generate the pair of public/private key. If you just specify a random file name without location, it will create the pair of
keys in the current directory, and if you add the public key to github settings then you can start pushing your code.
ssh-keygen
2 . If you want to give the location of identity file. Follow through this process:
Start the SSH Agent in the background process:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
3. add the location of the identity file
ssh-agent ssh-add "/c/Users/Anuj Sharma/.ssh/id_rsa"
4. verify with handshake which ssh key is getting used.
ssh -vvv git@github.com
5. git init (creates an empty repo in your local)
6. git add --all (add all files for local staging)
7. git commit -m "" (commit all the files)
8. git set remote url <remote-repo-git-url>
9. git push -u origin master (pushes the code to remote repo)
